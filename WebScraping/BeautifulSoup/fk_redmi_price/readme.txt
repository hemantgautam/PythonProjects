This Project make a use of requrests and BeautifulSoup python libraries to scrap product price( I have used mobile phone for example).
Its using Apscheduler package also to schedule this everyday so that if product price comes down I will be notified by email.
To make this code work, email and and password, from and to email addresses needs to add in flipkart.py file in line no 40 and 46, 47.
Dont forget to create requirements.txt file by using pip freeze > requirements.txt.
