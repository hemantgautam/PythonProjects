# PythonProjects
This Django project can be used to quickly create a single page Resume website. It's a very basic use of the Django MVT framework. As this is static so there is no ORM concept implemented. But this can be enhanced in the same project by adding the model.
It a great learning project.

To edit the resume details, just edit the index.html file present inside the "templates" folder, then install all the required packages(mentioned in requirements.txt file) and run the server locally.
